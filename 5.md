# 5. ADXL335

The ADXL335 is a low power, complete 3-axis accelerometer with analog outputs. The sensor measures acceleration with a minimum full-scale range of Â±3 g. It can measure the static acceleration of gravity in tilt-sensing applications, as well as dynamic acceleration resulting from motion, shock, or vibration. It captures the x, y and z channel at the same time.

**5.1 How to connect and use the sensor**

* Follow the layout in the Figure 8 below and connect the sensor with the mote:

* Connect the sensor with the computer (see section 4.2).
* Go to the directory `/home/user/snowfort/snowfort_example` in the terminal. 
* Open the file `ADXL335_example.c` and look for the line with `#define SAMPLE_RATE 20` so you can adjust the frequency.
* Save the change.
* Compile and load the file `ADXL335_example.c` into your mote (see section 4.3).
* Log into your mote (see section 4.4).
* You should see the output messages like the Figure 9 below:

**5.2 How to interpret data**

In the output, the first column represents the acceleration on x-axis, the second column is the acceleration on y-axis, the third column is the acceleration on z-axis, and the fourth column is a voltage reference.

The following formula is used in order to get the real acceleration values:
	
			V_in = reading value/4095 * 1.5V
			Acc = (V_in - 1.5V)/(300mV/g)
