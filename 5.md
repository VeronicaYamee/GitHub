# 5. ADXL335

The ADXL335 is a low power, complete 3-axis accelerometer with analog outputs. The sensor measures acceleration with a minimum full-scale range of Â±3 g. It can measure the static acceleration of gravity in tilt-sensing applications, as well as dynamic acceleration resulting from motion, shock, or vibration. It captures the x, y and z channel at the same time.

**5.1 How to connect and use the sensor**

* Follow the layout in the Figure below and connect the sensor with the mote:

* Connect the sensor with the computer (see section 4.2).
* Go to the directory home/user/NTU_test/NTU_test/snowfort_example in your terminal. **make changes**
* Open the file "MPU6050_Acc.c" and change the line 23 (line 33) to: **make changes**

		# define SAMPLING_FREQ 2
* Save the change.
* Compile and load "MPU6050_Acc.c" into your mote (see section 4.3). **make changes**
* Log into your mote (see section 4.4).
* You should see the output messages like the Figure below:
