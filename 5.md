# 5. ADXL335

The ADXL335 is a low power, complete 3-axis accelerometer with analog outputs. The sensor measures acceleration with a minimum full-scale range of Â±3 g. It can measure the static acceleration of gravity in tilt-sensing applications, as well as dynamic acceleration resulting from motion, shock, or vibration. It captures the x, y and z channel at the same time.
