# **4. MPU 6050**
The MPU-6050 is a sensor which contains an accelerometer and a gyroscope in a single chip and uses a standard I2C-bus for data transmission. It is very accurate as it contains 16-bits analog to digital conversion hardware for each channel. It captures the x, y and z channel at the same time.

**4.1 How to conect and use the sensor**

* Follow the layout in the figure below to connect the sensor with the mote.

* Connect the sensor with the computer (see section 4.2).
* Go to the directory `/home/user/snowfort/snowfort_example` in your terminal.
* Open the file `MPU6050_example.c` and look for the line with `#define SAMPLE_RATE 20` so you can choose the frequency you need and save the change.

The time here is represented by ticks instead of seconds. The timer on the mote uses 1024 ticks to represent 1 second. Here, instead of defining the sampling rate in seconds, we use ticks to represent it. For example, if we want to have a sampling frequency of 50Hz, the associated sampling rate (as an integer) in ticks is computed as follows:
	
		Sample_rate = 1024/50 = 20

* Compile and load `MPU6050_example.c` into your mote (see section 4.3).
* Log into your mote (see section 4.4).
* You should see the output messages like the figure that follows:

**4.2 Connect with the computer**

* To connect the sensor with the computer, plug the USB cable to the mote and the computer like the figure below:

**4.3 Compile**

* To compile the file and upload this file to the mote, type:

		sudo ./build.sh make 1 MPU_example 1

**4.4 Login**

* To log into the mote, type:

		sudo ./build.sh login

**4.5 How to interpret the data** 

The output messages were shown previously in Figure 6. The first three columns represent the acceleration on x-axis, on the y-axis and on the z-axis, respectively. The fourth column represents the temperature, and the last three columns represent the angular velocity on x, y and z axes, respectively. The line on the code responsible for this output is `PRINTF("%d,%d,%d,%d,%d,%d,%d\n",sample_data.data.accel_x,sample_data.data.accel_y,sample_data.data.accel_z,sample_data.data.tp,sample_data.data.gyro_x,sample_data.data.gyro_y,sample_data.data.gyro_z);`.


* Accelerometer

The datasheet indicates four different sensitivities. Each sensitivity has a correspondent scale factor as shown below:
  
|  Sensitivity  | Scale Factor |
|:-------------:|:------------:|
|      ±2g      |     16,384   |
|      ±4g      |     8,192    |
|      ±8g      |     4,096    |
|      ±16g     |     2,048    |

So, for example, if you use a sensitivity of 2g, you have to divide the output by 16,384 to get the real acceleration reading. 		

* Gyroscope

Again, the datasheet shows four different sensitivities with their respectives scale factors as follows:

|    Sensitivity    | Scale Factor |
|:-----------------:|:------------:|
|     ±250°/sec     |     131      |
|     ±500°/sec     |     65.5     |
|     ±1000°/sec    |     32.8     |
|     ±2000°/sec    |     16.4     |

If you use a sensitivity of 250°/sec, you have to divide the output by 131 in order to get the real angular velocity reading.
