# **4. MPU 6050**
The MPU-6050 is a sensor which contains an accelerometer and a gyroscope in a single chip and uses a standard I2C-bus for data transmission. It is very accurate as it contains 16-bits analog to digital conversion hardware for each channel. It captures the x, y and z channel at the same time.

**4.1 How to conect and use the sensor**

* Follow the layout in Fig. 5 to connect the sensor with the mote.

* Connect the sensor with the computer (see section 4.2).
* Go to the directory `/home/user/snowfort/snowfort_example` in your terminal.
* Open the file `MPU6050_example.c` and look for the line with `#define SAMPLE_RATE 20` so you can choose the frequency you need.

`The system time is measured by a system clock, which is implemented as a simple count of the number of ticks that have transpired since some arbitrary starting date. A tick is an arbitrary unit for measuring system time. The number of ticks per second is the frequency of the system timer. The frequency is measured in hertz.`

**EXPLAIN FREQUENCY/RATE/TICKS (CONVERSION)**

* Save the change.
* Compile and load `MPU6050_example.c` into your mote (see section 4.3).
* Log into your mote (see section 4.4).
* You should see the output messages like the Figure 6 below:

**4.2 Connect with the computer**

* To connect the sensor with the computer, plug the USB cable to the mote and the computer like the Figure 7 below:

**4.3 Compile**

* To compile the file and upload this file to the mote, type:

		sudo ./build.sh make 1 MPU_example 1

**4.4 Login**

* To log into the mote, type:

		sudo ./build.sh login

**4.5 How to interpret the data** 

The output messages were shown previously in Figure 6. The first three columns represent the acceleration on x-axis, on the y-axis and on the z-axis, respectively. The fourth column represents the temperature, and the last three columns represent the angular velocity on x, y and z axes, respectively. The line on the code responsible for this output is `PRINTF("%d,%d,%d,%d,%d,%d,%d\n",sample_data.data.accel_x,sample_data.data.accel_y,sample_data.data.accel_z,sample_data.data.tp,sample_data.data.gyro_x,sample_data.data.gyro_y,sample_data.data.gyro_z);`.


* Accelerometer

The datasheet indicates four different sensitivities. Each sensitivity has a correspondent scale factor as shown below:
  
|  Sensitivity  | Scale Factor |
|:-------------:|:------------:|
|      ±2g      |     16,384   |
|      ±4g      |     8,192    |
|      ±8g      |     4,096    |
|      ±16g     |     2,048    |

So, for example, if you use a sensitivity of 2g, you have to divide the output by 16,384 to get the real acceleration reading. 		

* Gyroscope

Again, the datasheet shows four different sensitivities with their respectives scale factors as follows:

|    Sensitivity    | Scale Factor |
|:-----------------:|:------------:|
|     ±250°/sec     |     131      |
|     ±500°/sec     |     65.5     |
|     ±1000°/sec    |     32.8     |
|     ±2000°/sec    |     16.4     |

If you use a sensitivity of 250°/sec, you have to divide the output by 131 in order to get the real angular velocity reading.
