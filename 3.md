3. Using _build.sh_ script
-
 In order to simplify the compile process, SnowFort has a script to run all the **basic** commands automatically. This example will help you to get familiar with this script.

- Go to the directory ?? in the Terminal
- The file _build.sh_ runs as follows:

		$ sudo ./build.sh < action > < file name > < sensor id > **ESPAÃ‡O**

- To clean all the compiled files, use:

		$ sudo ./build.sh clean

- To compile a file and upload this file to the mote, type:

		$ sudo ./build.sh make < file name > < sensor id >
File name is the source file that you want to compile. You should not include its attributes. For example, to compile ABC.c, the file name is "ABC", not "ABC.c". The sensor id has to be larger than 0.

- To log into the mote, use:

		$ sudo ./build.sh login


**3.1. Using _build.sh_ script to create executable application**


- For on target application, use:

		sudo ./build.sh make USB_ID APP_NAME SENSOR_ID

E.g.:

	sudo ./build.sh make 1 helloWorld 10

USB_ID refers to the USB port number. The first mote connected with the USB is 1 and the second mote connected with the USB is 2. etc...

- For MSP simulation application, use:

		sudo ./build.sh test 1 APP_NAME SENSOR_ID

- For logging into target, use:

		sudo ./build.sh login
